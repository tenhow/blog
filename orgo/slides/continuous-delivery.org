* What is Continuous Delivery
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
/Continuous Delivery/[fn:2] is the *ability* to get changes of all types including new *features*, configuration *changes*, bug *fixes* and *experiments* into *PRODUCTION*, or into the hands of users, *safely* and *quickly* in a *sustainable* way.
#+END_QUOTE
* What is Continuous Integration
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
/Continuous Integration/[fn:3] is a software development *practice* where members of a team *integrate* their work *frequently*, usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is *verified* by an *automated build* (including test) to *detect* integration *errors* as *quickly* as possible.
#+END_QUOTE
* Why Continuous Delivery
** Low risk releases

[[https://www.evernote.com/l/ABeIYFLHPiBG-5ExmehzW-_cH1GiX4jVXHYB/image.jpg]]

- release fast
- release often
- increment
- decouple release and deployment

** Faster time to market
[[https://www.evernote.com/l/ABeA0Sr5KGdNTLBperhbcqTtN5dwR0XulVQB/image.png]]

- no manual regressions
- avoid the large amounts of re-work

** Higher quality

- discover *regressions* within minutes
- teams are freed to *focus* on *higher level* exploratory testing, usability testing, performance and security testing
- ensuring quality is built in to products and services from the beginning
** Lower Cost
Any successful software product or service will evolve significantly over the course of its lifetime.

** Better products

[[https://www.evernote.com/l/ABe34B0bA6ZNy7zzN3smjKTa-Fp6JxG9KnwB/image.png]]

- shorten feedback cycle
- avoid features we build that deliver zero value

** Happier teams

* Why Continuous Integration

#+BEGIN_CENTER
Same reason as [[Why Continuous Delivery]]
#+END_CENTER
* Evolutionary architecture

[[https://continuousdelivery.com/images/strangler.png]]

* Essentials[fn:4]
** Maintain a single-source repository

[[https://www.evernote.com/l/ABdzsWIdHuJOfZ2FjTGVWuABXkRMouqkX8AB/image.png]]

- no feature branches
- every commit on =origin/master= should be deployable
- feature toggles[fn:6]

** Make your build self-testing

- repeatable
- scalable
- maintainable

** Automate the build
[[./images/futurama_June_30__2016_at_0906PM.gif]]

- no manual steps
- each step till release should be automated

** Fix broken builds immediately

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Keep it green
#+END_QUOTE

** Keep the build fast

[[./images/futurama_June_29__2016_at_1154PM.gif]]

** Test in a clone of the production environment

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
It works on my machine!
#+END_QUOTE

- same platform
- smoke test your deployments
- replica prod data if possible
- dockerize everything if you can

** Make it easy for anyone to get the latest executable

[[https://www.evernote.com/l/ABevhNc9M9VGEbMFB9JgqIHF9JsU3OHtenkB/image.png]]

** Automate deployment

[[./images/futurama_June_10__2016_at_1101PM.gif]]

- every success build should be able to automate deploy
- every build should be able to rollback instantly[fn:7]
- 0 downtime deployment
- automate data migration
- Only build packages once

* Pipeline

** Journey from code to product

[[https://www.evernote.com/l/ABeRk2yi3kFFV4mFxn1K-vOBbNhLOoFSqa8B/image.jpg]]

** Pipeline as Code

[[https://github.com/drone/brand/raw/master/screenshots/screenshot_build_success.png]]

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
pipeline:
  backend:
    image: golang
    commands:
      - go get
      - go build
      - go test

  frontend:
    image: node:6
    commands:
      - npm install
      - npm test

  publish:
    image: plugins/docker
    repo: octocat/hello-world
    tags: [ 1, 1.1, latest ]
    registry: index.docker.io
