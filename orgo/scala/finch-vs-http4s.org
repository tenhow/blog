#+TITLE: Finch vs Http4s, which is FPer
#+DATE: <2018-12-11 Tue>
#+AUTHOR: Jichao Ouyang

This is purely personal overall comparation from Functional Programming point of view, which only
consider composible, extensible, and joy of FP. Performance and eco system are out of the scope.

The explicit version that I'm comparing here is finch 0.26.1 and Http4s 0.20-M4

Definition:

- /composible/: how easy to build blocks from existing components
- /extensible/: how easy to add support for new type
- /joy of FP/: how many FP knowledges are actually practiced

Scale from 1 to 5:

** Finch

*** composible: üçé üçé üçé üçé
finch takes full advantage of shapeless' product and coproduct to routes *Matcher*
#+BEGIN_SRC scala
val getApples = get("apple") { Ok("üçéüçé")} 
val getApple = get("apple" :: path[Int]) { (id: Int) => Ok("üçé")}

val routes = getApples :+: getApple
#+END_SRC

=::= here is a product, means the path will match if there is an ="apple"= and an Int in the path =path[Int]=

=:+:= constructs a coproduct, which means either getApples or getApple matched route will match

About *Middleware*, finch need to mix finagle filter to do the job. so it will end up very ugly and inconsistent from the routes above
#+BEGIN_SRC scala
  class AuthFilter(implicit ttf: ToTwitterFuture[ProgramF]) extends SimpleFilter[Request, Response] {
    def apply(req: Request, service: Service[Request, Response]): Future[Response] = {
      (req.path, req.headerMap.get("TOKEN")) match {
        case ("/login", _)        => service(req)
        case (url, Some(token)) => ??? // fetch user info and pass to service
#+END_SRC

and then compose filter and service
#+BEGIN_SRC scala
 new AuthFilter andThen routes.toServiceAs[Application.Json]
#+END_SRC

you may have notice that the finangle filter is more lower level verbose code and inconsistent with the previous shapeless DSL.

*** extensible: üçé üçé
finch has a lot of internal custom types, e.g. the magic happen behind the DSL above:
#+BEGIN_SRC scala
val getApples = get("apple") { Ok("üçéüçé")} 
#+END_SRC
is:

1. string "apple" will implicitly convert into =Endpoint[Unit]=
2. =get("apple")= will covert =Endpoint[Unit]= into function =Mapper[F, In] => Endpoint[F, Out]=
basically just =Cont=, taking Mapper as parameter and wrapping itself.
3. Another implicit conversion will take place in =Ok("")=, from ~Output[String] => Mapper[F, String]~

If you didn't follow, that's fine, because there is so many implicit conversion and internal custom types
took place here.

But think about it, because all implicit conversion was well-defined in finch internally
we've restricted to the types they provided.

For example my controller will actually return me a [[https://typelevel.org/cats/datatypes/freemonad.html][Free Monad]] i.e. =Free[Program, Output[String]]=

How can I get it to work with the router?

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
val getApples = get("apple") { Free[Program, Output[String]].pure(Ok("üçéüçé"))} 
#+END_SRC

it won't compile because the implicit conversion expecting an =Output[_]= type

actually it only supports =IO[_]=, =Output[_]=, =Response=

UPDATE: from [[https://github.com/finagle/finch/pull/1045][0.27.0]] it supports custom converter to convert any user custom type to IO

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
implicit val conv = new ToEffect[Free[Program, ?], IO] {
def apply[A](a: Free[Program, A]): IO[A] = ???
}
val getApples = get("apple") { Free[Program, Output[String]].pure(Ok("üçéüçé"))} 
#+END_SRC

But still, it's so many implicits magic happen behind and the journey wasn't so fun.


*** joy of FP: üçé üçé üçé

except some funs from shapeless there aren't actually any cats interop during composition of routes

While that could be much more attractive to beginner friendly though, since user don't have to have
any knowledge about cats before using finch.

** Http4s
*** composible: üçé üçé üçé üçé üçé
meanwhile, http4s takes advantage of cats to achieve path *Matcher*
#+BEGIN_SRC scala
val getApples = HttpRoutes.of[IO] {
  case GET -> Root / "apple" => Ok("üçéüçé")
}
val getApple = HttpRoutes.of[IO] {
  case GET -> Root / "apple" / id => Ok("üçé")
}

val routes = getApples <+> getApple
#+END_SRC

what happen here is =HttpRoutes.of[IO] {...}= return a data type [[https://typelevel.org/cats/datatypes/kleisli.html][=Kleisli{OptionT{F, ?}, Request{F}, F{Response{F}}}=]]

=<+>= is [[https://typelevel.org/cats/typeclasses/semigroupk.html][combindK]] of ~SemigroupK[Kleisli[OptionT[F, ?], Request[F], ?]]~

You may already realize that nothing of above make any sense to you if you aren't
familiar with data types and typeclasses defined in cats or scalaz.

It requires some knowledge background from cats, just like you should know some sort of shapeless to fully understand what the hell is =::= and =:+:= about.

Short story, /Kleisli/ is a generic data type representing a function =A => F[B]=

so you could imagine that =Kleisli[OptionT[F, ?], Request[F], F[Response[F]]]= is just something like
=Request[F] => OptionT[F, F[Response[F]]]=

while =<+>= is very like =:+:=, it combines these Kleisli, but any of these match, it will
return that matched Kleisli

About *Middleware*, it's nothing more just compose a Kleisli of type =Kleisli[Option[F,?], Request[F], F[Request[F]]]= before
or compose a Kleisli of type =Kleisli[Option[F,?], Response[F], F[Response[F]]]= after

e.g. auth user before =getApple=
#+BEGIN_SRC scala
  def auth = Kleisli { req: Request[IO] =>
    findUserInDatabase(req) match {
      case true => OptionT(IO(Some(req)))
      case false => OptionT.fromOption[IO](None)
    }
  }

  auth andThen getApple
#+END_SRC
*** extensible: üçé üçé üçé üçé üçé

Since route matcher is simply just Kleisli, extending http4s to support types other than =F[Response[F]]= will
be much simpler.

For the same example as above in finch, that my controller will return a free program =Free[Program, IO[Response[IO]]]= instead of =IO[Response[IO]]=

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
  // type alias for route that return free monad
  type FreeRoute[F[_]] =
    Kleisli[OptionT[F, ?], Request[F], ProgramF[F[Response[F]]]]

  // custom dsl
  def route[F[_]: Monad](
    pf: PartialFunction[Request[F], ProgramF[F[Response[F]]]]): FreeRoute[F] =
    Kleisli(
      (req: Request[F]) => OptionT(implicitly[Monad[F]].pure(pf.lift(req))))

  val getApples = route {
    case GET -> Root / "apple" => Ok("üçéüçé").pure[Free[Program,?]]
  }
#+END_SRC

since getApples is still Kleisli, all the methods such as =<+>= are still available

to hook it back to http4s route, simply map interpreter to =getApples=

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
val interp: Program ~> IO = ???

val router = getApples flatMapF interp
#+END_SRC

here I used flatMapF because interp will give it another =IO=, which need to be flatten

Since Http4s takes full power of data type Kleisli, since Kleisli at the end is just a function, it's much more composable and extensible in every way.

Once you have some knowledge around cats data types and typeclasses, you'll be able to enable all cats power in http4s for free. Since Kleisli has instances
for:
- Functor
- Applicative
- Monad
- Alternative
- Choice
- Arrow
- Parallel
- Monoid
- MonoidK
...

As you can see it already cover most of the cats typeclasses, plus, those typeclasses are almost the most popular typeclasses in FP and cats. 

And you will get all the chance to practiceall thee fun in your http4s server
by just using Kleisli data type.
